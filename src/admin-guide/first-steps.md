# First steps

## Clone the repositories


Clone the RABIT repository and all submodules.

```
git clone https://github.com/FIT3170-FY-Project-7/RABIT-COMMON.git --recursive
```

## Switch branch

If you are running the stable version of RABIT, switch to the `main` branch in both `RABIT-FRONTEND` and `RABIT-BACKEND`.

If you are developing RABIT, switch to `dev` in `RABIT-FRONTEND` and `RABIT-BACKEND`, then make a new branch as desired using conventions outlined [here](/dev-guide/contributing-code.md#frontend-and-backend-repositories)

## Next steps

Proceed to either [Docker](./docker.md) or [manual install](./manual-install.md) pages, depending on your deployment
method.
